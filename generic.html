								<h2>Project Ideas</h2>
								<p>Doing this project will can help me to develop some of the necessary skills needed for my ideal job which will move me one step closer to what I want for my future and help me progress to new skills that are required for my ideal job. In addition, the valuable experience in creating this application, website and database.</p>

									<h3 class="major">PC Components Searcher</h3>
									<p>The project idea is an application and website for both phones and computer that can find components for a pc that fulfills the requirements that a user has, for their needs in their work and personal life. The application and website will be connected to a database that stores the different components and brands that make the components, which will also store the related specifications of the parts that would be in the database which will be retrieved when the user sends a request for the information they want.</p>
									<p>This idea seems great to me as I like computers very much, though I don’t know computers to an extensive degree, I do know a few things and this idea can help many people who don’t really care about what the different parts do but need an adequate pc for what they do. So, this application will be useful for those who just want to buy and/or build their own pc when they do not know much about different parts and their specifications, allowing them to find the most optimal pc parts for what they need easily and quickly which can save both time and money. It can also be used for those who want to find a bit more information about computer parts.</p>
									<p>The user will be able to first set the specifications that they need for their computer, if they do not know what they will need the application will be able to provide basic information to the user about what each specification affects and how they function. If the user wants more in-depth information about the different components and brands, there will be an entire page dedicated to explaining them for the user. Once the requirements are set the application will make a list with different categories of both different parts e.g. CPU, GPU, RAM, Motherboards, PC Casings, etc. And brands e.g. Nvidia, AMD, Intel, etc. It will then filter the possible options within the list that fit the requirements to what the user wants e.g. lowest price to highest price or price range. Every product is placed in a category with different components and brands and will have a page containing all its specifications and a link to the company’s website that creates the product. And even without a set of requirements the user will still be able to search for specific parts whether it is through the brand they want to use or the type of component it is or both or possibly through the exact name of the product they want to find. The application will also be able to suggest a pc build that fit their needs if they want it, choosing the cheapest components that will be able to run what the user wants to use the computer for. There will also be a forum page that users can ask for help and/or advice from other users more experienced in computers and are willing to help. with the forum page the users will need a way to identify their own posts, so, the users will need to create and use an account that will require the user to enter an email, username and password which will then allow the user to post and comment on other posts.</p>
									<p>The Tools and technology that will be needed would be any kind of programming software that can create an application, website and database will be needed and a computer to run the software. Also, phones with different IOS’ will be needed to test the application e.g. Apple and Android, and the phones used to test the application should not be expensive phones that most people do not have the money to get. A domain will be needed to host the website, along with the hardware, that can be dedicated to run as a server 24/7, to store the website and database and to communicate with the users or alternatively, to use another business’ hardware to host the website.</p>
									<p>The kind of skills required for this project would be any kind of programming language capable of creating an application, preferably JavaScript as it is to improve my skills for my ideal job and to become more familiar with JavaScript, and SQL for the database, additionally, html and css will be needed to create the website. Getting the skills needed aren’t too difficult as there are many resources online and I am currently attending an IT program as such there are many sources to gather information from. The software and hardware that is needed would also not be too difficult since there’re free software that can be used. And the hardware can be replaced by using another business’ hardware to host the website or if it is to be hosted locally then the cost to gather the needed hardware should be affordable.</p>
									<p>If this project were to be successfully completed than hopefully there will be people who use it and is able to help save the precious time and money of its user. And if it is being used by consumers, this means many people will have a place to go to where it would be easy to find the parts they need, that they can afford to build their new pc. Even if they do not know a single thing about computers before entering the website or application they can access the information that explains what they need to know to find the parts that clears all their requirements for their use, and if they still do not understand they are able to ask for help on the forums page. This will allow even those who are technologically challenged to be able to make their own personal pc and learn new things in this technological world that we live in.</p>
