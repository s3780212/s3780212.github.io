											<h2 class="major">Personal Information</h2>
											<p>My name is Micheal Trinh, I was born in Australia and have recently started under-graduate studies. The most i know about IT is the very basics of some parts of IT, so i have much to learn in this program. I play a lot of games, the genres i play are very broad however i generally tend to avoid games that do not have very much gameplay, for example visual novels.</p>

										<h2 class="major">Interest in IT</h2>
										<p>IT is something that is  implemented in the everyday lives of everyone in one way or another whether in their work life or in their personal life. As such, IT is a field that will constantly be in demand. I had chosen RMIT as it is an easy to commute to compared to other universities, and i am expecting that at RMIT i will be learning all the basics of IT.</p>

											<p>The job involves working with javascript as a developer who will be working in a team, it is expected that you are able to work overtime from time to time. However, you will have more flexibility with taking time off from working hours when needed. It is nice as it is very high paying, which is very very likable. It is required that you are familiar in building SPA, javascript technology, building relational databases, working in agile environments and has understanding of building and maintaining customer-facing APIs, source control tools and processes, DevOps and CI/CD and infrastructure and supporting services. All these requirements will require a lot of effort as i do not have any of the skills and experience needed to attempt at their selection process, as such to obtain these skills and experiences i plan to learn skills from RMIT and make improvements to myself over time.</p>

										<p>The results from the Myers-Briggs Personality Test indicate that i am a versatile person who can adjust and work on different tasks, which i personally think is wrong as i am not very good at many different things. The Learning Style Test tells me that i learn more from visual interpretation, meaning i should focus more when observing. The Big Five Personality Test show that i have higher emotional stability than most people, but lower in the other four aspects than many other people. However, I do not believe that i am a very critical, aggressive or impulsive person.</p>
										<p>I do not believe these results will affect me as a team member or my behaviour. however, it is always possible i may subconsciously try to do things within the team differently with the three test results in mind, possibly in behaviour, being possibly more interactive. Thought process, in a way that i might take a different approach on an issue then i normally would have.</p>
										<p>I should find team members that can communicate with me whether or not i am affected by the test results, allowing me and my team members to cooperate properly and complete the tasks efficiently and effectively. And i should adapt to my team members to make sure that cooperation is viable, as cooperation is a vital part of a team and without it will likely cause many problems.
